# Sina-Weibo-Dataset-190
Dataset of the paper: "Online Continuous Learning of Users Suicidal Risk on Social Media".

This dataset contains the open posts of 95 suicidal users and 95 non-suicidal users on Sina Weibo from November 1, 2016 to April 30, 2019. Each suicidal risk user is assigned a suicide risk level on a weekly basis.

To receive access, you will need to read, sign, and send back the attached data usage agreement (DUA).

The DUA contains restrictions on how you can use the data. We would like to draw your attention to several restrictions in particular:
- You cannot transfer or reproduce any part of the data set. This includes publishing parts of users' posts.
- You cannot attempt to identify any user in the data set.
- You cannot contact any user in the data set.

If your institution has issues with language in the DUA, please have the responsible person at your institution contact us with their concerns and suggested modifications.

Once the Primary Investigator has signed the DUA, the Primary Investigator should email the signed form to caolei@bnu.edu.cn. We will then send you the dataset along with a dataset description file. All Weibo data is stored in TXT format, making it easy to read using simple text processing methods, such as the open function in Python.
